# Intro
This file will contain all the experiements being done to try to solve the environment using Dreamer V3 and some custom changes are required. 

### Things completed
* Initial search which algorithm should I try. I am chosing to try using Dreamer V3. Original Code in Jax: 

### Things in progress
* Reading the algorithms
  * Dreamerv1, Dreamerv2, Dreamerv3. Trying to understand the high-level ideas in order to easily be able to use these models. Also uploaded the pdfs for the papers.

* Trying out [sheeprl](https://github.com/Eclectic-Sheep/sheeprl) Dreamer V3 on
  * easy environments (as suggested in the instructions for report, Pendulum-v0, LunarLander-v2 and HalfCheetah
  * Reading: Looks like there's a way to add [custom environments](https://github.com/Eclectic-Sheep/sheeprl/blob/main/howto/add_environment.md).
